# cocapn

**Cluster:** fleet-agent-infra  
**Language:** Python  
**Source:** [SuperInstance/cocapn](https://github.com/SuperInstance/cocapn)

## Intention

repo-first Agent for local or cloud. grow an agent in a repo using the repo itself as the muscle-memory. Run from localhost, from pages.dev, or embedded into any platform app. Move to gitlab or anywhere and optimize git as the agent infrastructure itself. wiki for knowledge, repos for skills, pipelines anywhere

## How It Works

It Fits
- [OpenConstruct Documentation](https://github.com/SuperInstance/openconstruct-docs) — ecosystem-wide docs and guides

Cocapn is the foundation of the [SuperInstance fleet](https://github.com/SuperInstance):

- **[cocapn-sdk](https://github.com/SuperInstance/cocapn-sdk)** — One API key, any AI model
- **[cocapn-cli](https://github.com/SuperInstance/cocapn-cli)** — Fleet terminal formatting (Rust)
- **[cocapn-explain](https://github.com/SuperInstance/cocapn-explain)** — Agent explainability
- **[cocapn-health-rs](https://github.com/SuperInstance/cocapn-health-rs)** — Fleet health monito

## What It's For

repo-first Agent for local or cloud. grow an agent in a repo using the repo itself as the muscle-memory. Run from localhost, from pages.dev, or embedded into any platform app. Move to gitlab or anywhere and optimize git as the agent infrastructure itself. wiki for knowledge, repos for skills, pipelines anywhere

## Who Would Use It

Developers and researchers in the SuperInstance fleet ecosystem.

## Language / Stack

Python — part of the SuperInstance ecosystem.

## Status Assessment

- **Quality tier:** real-project
- **Note:** Well-documented (92 lines). Working examples and usage.

## Honest Assessment

Well-documented with working examples. Genuine project within the ecosystem. AI-created but shows real engineering. May see production use within the fleet.

# cocapn — Repo-First Agent Infrastructure

> **📚 Documentation:** [`PLUG_AND_PLAY.md`](./PLUG_AND_PLAY.md) · [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](./GETTING_STARTED.md) · [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) · [`API_REFERENCE.md`](./API_REFERENCE.md) · [`LOW_LEVEL.md`](./LOW_LEVEL.md)

**Grow an agent inside a repo. Tiles capture knowledge, rooms train, the flywheel compounds.**

## What This Gives You

- **Tiles** — atomic knowledge units that remember every Q&A, tagged and versioned
- **Rooms** — self-training collections of tiles that get smarter over time
- **Flywheel** — every exchange improves the next: responses feed tiles, tiles improve rooms, rooms sharpen answers
- **Interactive agent** — `python agent.py` starts a CLI that learns from you in real time
- **Zero infra** — pure Python, data lives in JSONL files next to your code

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install cocapn

# Start talking to your agent — it learns from every exchange
cocapn

# Teach it directly
cocapn --teach "What is PLATO?" "The pedagogical framework for fleet curriculum"

# Check how smart it's gotten
cocapn --status
```

Or use it as a library:

```python
from cocapn import CocapnAgent, Tile, Room, Flywheel

agent = CocapnAgent(name="my-agent")
response = agent.ask("What is the fleet?")
agent.teach("What is the fleet?", "A coordinated group of AI agents")
agent.save()  # Persists tiles and rooms
```

## API Reference

### `Tile`
```python
Tile(question="Q", answer="A", domain="general", confidence=0.5, tags=["tag"])
```
Atomic knowledge unit. Tracks usage count, success count, version, and confidence.

### `Room`
```python
Room(name="python", description="Python knowledge", store=tile_store)
```
A self-training collection of tiles. Feed it Q&A pairs, ask questions — it ranks tiles by relevance and learns from outcomes.

### `Flywheel`
```python
Flywheel(data_dir="data")
```
The compounding engine. Manages rooms, routes questions, tracks which answers worked.

### `CocapnAgent`
```python
CocapnAgent(name="agent", data_dir="data")
```
High-level interface: `ask()`, `teach()`, `status()`, `save()`.
