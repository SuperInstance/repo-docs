## Intention

Captain agent — fleet commanding vessel, strategic coordination for the Cocapn fleet

## How It Works

It Fits
- [OpenConstruct Documentation](https://github.com/SuperInstance/openconstruct-docs) — ecosystem-wide docs and guides

The commanding vessel of the [SuperInstance fleet](https://github.com/SuperInstance). Receives dispatched work from [Co-Captain](https://github.com/SuperInstance/co-captain-git-agent) and distributes it across fleet agents.

Captain agent — fleet commanding vessel, strategic coordination for the Cocapn fleet

## Who Would Use It

Developers and researchers in the SuperInstance fleet ecosystem.

## Language / Stack

Python — part of the SuperInstance ecosystem.

## Status Assessment

- **Quality tier:** real-project
- **Note:** Well-documented (81 lines). Working examples and usage.

## Honest Assessment

Well-documented with working examples. Genuine project within the ecosystem. AI-created but shows real engineering. May see production use within the fleet.

```
# captain — Fleet Commanding Vessel

**Team leadership, task prioritization, strategy selection, and fleet coordination for multi-agent systems.**

## What This Gives You

- **Priority queues** — weighted task prioritization with deadline tracking and dynamic reordering
- **Strategy engine** — select and apply coordination strategies (sequential, parallel, adaptive) based on task requirements
- **Fleet coordination** — assign vessels to tasks, track availability, balance workloads
- **Leadership styles** — configurable leadership modes (directive, collaborative, delegative) that affect task distribution
- **Status reports** — structured fleet health reports with metrics, health status, and trend data

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install captain
```

```python
from captain import Captain, LeadershipStyle, Task, Priority

# Create a captain with a leadership style
captain = Captain(name="fleet-captain", style=LeadershipStyle.ADAPTIVE)

# Add fleet vessels
from captain import FleetVessel, FleetCoordination
coord = FleetCoordination()
coord.register(FleetVessel(id="agent-1", capabilities=["rust", "benchmarking"]))
coord.register(FleetVessel(id="agent-2", capabilities=["python", "docs"]))

# Create and prioritize tasks
task = Task(title="Rewrite README", priority=Priority.HIGH, deadline="2026-06-01")
captain.assign(task, fleet=coord)

# Run strategy
from captain import StrategyEngine, Strategy, ResourceBudget
engine = StrategyEngine()
plan = engine.plan(tasks=captain.pending_tasks, fleet=coord, budget=ResourceBudget(max_agents=5))
print(plan)

# Get status report
report = captain.report()
print(f"Fleet health: {report.health}")
print(f"Tasks in progress: {report.metrics.tasks_in_progress}")
```
