## Intention

Vision/Fitness Turbo-Shell for cocapn domain

## How It Works

Each log line is checked against every enabled, non-throttled rule in the session. When a rule's pattern matches:

1. A **notify** action is always generated.
2. If the rule is tagged `"snapshot"`, a **snapshot** action captures the matched line.
3. If the rule's threshold is ≥ 5, an **escalate** action is generated.
4. The rule enters a 60-second **throttle** cooldown, during which further matches are skipped.

Thresholds are evaluated against a sliding time window: a rule only fires when the number of matches within `window_seconds` reaches `threshold`. The default threshold is 1 (fire on ev

## What It's For

Vision/Fitness Turbo-Shell for cocapn domain

## Who Would Use It

Developers and researchers in the SuperInstance fleet ecosystem.

## Language / Stack

Python — part of the SuperInstance ecosystem.

## Status Assessment

- **Quality tier:** real-project
- **Note:** Well-documented (90 lines). Working examples and usage.

## Honest Assessment

Well-documented with working examples. Genuine project within the ecosystem. AI-created but shows real engineering. May see production use within the fleet.

# activelog-agent

A standalone log-monitoring and alerting toolkit for Python. Define rules that match log lines by substring, regex, or exact text, then process log streams through them to produce notification, escalation, throttle, and snapshot actions. Pure Python, zero runtime dependencies.

## Features

- **Pattern matching** — substring, regex, and exact-match rules
- **Threshold alerts** — fire after N matches within a configurable time window
- **Throttling** — every rule that fires enters a 60-second cooldown
- **Escalation** — rules with a threshold of 5 or higher also generate an escalate action
- **Snapshots** — rules tagged `"snapshot"` capture the matched line as context
- **State persistence** — save and load sessions to JSON via `MonitoringSession.save()` / `.load()`

## Installation

```bash
pip install activelog-agent
```

## Quick Start

```python
from activelog_agent import Agent, AlertRule, MatchType

agent = Agent()
rule = AlertRule(
    name="errors",
    pattern=r"ERROR|FATAL",
    match_type=MatchType.REGEX,
    threshold=3,
    window_seconds=60,
)
session = agent.create_session("prod-monitor", rules=[rule])
agent.start_session(session.id)

actions = agent.process_lines([
    "2026-05-26 INFO server started",
    "2026-05-26 ERROR connection refused",
    "2026-05-26 ERROR timeout",
    "2026-05-26 FATAL disk full",
], session.id)

for a in actions:
    print(f"[{a.action_type.value}] {a.message}")
```

## How It Works

Each log line is checked against every enabled, non-throttled rule in the session. When a rule's pattern matches:

1. A **notify** action is always generated.
2. If the rule is tagged `"snapshot"`, a **snapshot** action captures the matched line.
3. If the rule's threshold is ≥ 5, an **escalate** action is generated.
4. The rule enters a 60-second **throttle** cooldown, during which further matches are skipped.

Thresholds are evaluated against a sliding time window: a rule only fires when the number of matches within `window_seconds` reaches `threshold`. The default threshold is 1 (fire on every match).

## API Reference

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `agent.py` | `Agent` — creates sessions and processes log lines |
| `watcher.py` | `LogWatcher` — scans lines into `LogEntry` objects |
| `rule.py` | `AlertRule` — pattern matching and threshold logic |
| `action.py` | `Action` — action types: notify, escalate, throttle, snapshot |
| `session.py` | `MonitoringSession` — lifecycle, throttle state, and JSON persistence |

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

## Scope

- ✅ **Real today** — a standalone, zero-dependency log-monitoring toolkit. Every feature listed above (pattern matching, thresholds, throttling, escalation, snapshots, state persistence) is implemented and covered by the test suite.
- 🔮 **Later phase** — integration with a broader `activelog` pipeline (e.g. a separate `activelog-backend` store, downstream analytics) and running as a PLATO fleet agent are aspirat
