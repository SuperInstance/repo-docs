**Cluster:** rust-misc  
**Language:** Rust  
**Source:** [SuperInstance/crates-publish-check](https://github.com/SuperInstance/crates-publish-check)

## Intention

Check which Rust crates in a directory are ready for crates.io publishing

## How It Works

**Discovery phase:**
[code]

**Check pipeline (per crate):**
Each crate is processed through a series of checks, executed concurrently with configurable batch size:

1. **Metadata check:** Verify `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `repository` fields are present and non-empty in `[package]`.

2. **Uniqueness check:** Query crates.io API to see if the name is already taken (requires `reqwest` async HTTP).

3. **Compile check:** Run `cargo check` to verify the crate compiles without errors.

4. **Documentation check:** Verify `README.md` exists and is non-trivial (> 1KB).

5. **License

## What It's For

Check which Rust crates in a directory are ready for crates.io publishing

## Who Would Use It

Developers and researchers in the SuperInstance fleet ecosystem.

## Language / Stack

Rust — part of the SuperInstance ecosystem.

## Status Assessment

- **Quality tier:** substantial
- **Note:** Rich documentation (81 lines, 4307 chars). Architecture + motivation.

## Honest Assessment

Rich documentation with architecture, motivation, and code. Among the more serious projects. AI-created as part of agent fleet infrastructure, but with genuine depth and thinking.

# Crates Publish Check

**Crates Publish Check** is a Rust CLI tool that scans a directory of Rust crates and determines which are ready for publishing to crates.io — checking metadata completeness, license compliance, documentation, and optionally running `cargo publish --dry-run`.

## Why It Matters

Publishing a crate to crates.io requires more than working code: the manifest needs valid metadata (description, license, repository, keywords), the crate must compile without errors, documentation should be present, and the package must not contain secrets or large binary files. When managing a fleet of 40+ crates, manually checking each one before publication is error-prone and tedious. This tool automates the pre-publication checklist: it parses each `Cargo.toml`, validates the metadata against crates.io requirements, checks for common issues (missing README, missing license file, version conflicts), and optionally runs the actual dry-run publish to catch issues that static analysis misses.

## How It Works

**Discovery phase:**
```
discover(directory):
  for each subdirectory in directory:
    if subdirectory/Cargo.toml exists and contains "[package]":
      add to crate list
  also check directory itself (root-level crate)
```

**Check pipeline (per crate):**
Each crate is processed through a series of checks, executed concurrently with configurable batch size:

1. **Metadata check:** Verify `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `repository` fields are present and non-empty in `[package]`.

2. **Uniqueness check:** Query crates.io API to see if the name is already taken (requires `reqwest` async HTTP).

3. **Compile check:** Run `cargo check` to verify the crate compiles without errors.

4. **Documentation check:** Verify `README.md` exists and is non-trivial (> 1KB).

5. **License check:** Verify `LICENSE` file exists and matches the declared SPDX license.

6. **Dry-run publish (optional):** Run `cargo publish --dry-run` which performs the actual packaging and validation without uploading.

**Result aggregation:** Each crate is classified as Ready or Not Ready, with a list of issues for unready crates.

**Concurrency:** Crates are processed via `tokio::stream::buffer_unordered(batch_size)`, defaulting to 4 concurrent checks to avoid overwhelming the local cargo registry.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check all crates in a directory
cargo run -- /path/to/fleet

# Show only ready crates
cargo run -- --ready-only /path/to/fleet

# Output as JSON
cargo run -- --json /path/to/fleet

# Run dry-run publish on ready crates
cargo run -- --publish /path/to/fleet
```

## API

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `checks` | Per-crate validation logic |
| `models::CrateReport` | Full report for one crate |
| `report` | Formatted output (text/JSON) |
| `discover_crates` | Find all Cargo.toml in a directory tree |

## Architecture Notes

Crates Publish Check provides the **publication readiness gate** for the SuperInstance fleet. Within γ
