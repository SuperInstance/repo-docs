**Language:** Python  
**Source:** [SuperInstance/coordination-topology](https://github.com/SuperInstance/coordination-topology)

## Intention

Online TE/entropy/IAT/Euler algorithms for multi-agent fleet coordination topology

## How It Works

Online Transfer Entropy (TE), source entropy, inter-arrival time (IAT) autocorrelation, and Euler characteristic computation for multi-agent fleet coordination topology.

## What It's For

Online TE/entropy/IAT/Euler algorithms for multi-agent fleet coordination topology

## Who Would Use It

Developers and researchers in the SuperInstance fleet ecosystem.

## Language / Stack

Python — part of the SuperInstance ecosystem.

## Status Assessment

- **Quality tier:** real-project
- **Note:** Well-documented (107 lines). Working examples and usage.

## Honest Assessment

Well-documented with working examples. Genuine project within the ecosystem. AI-created but shows real engineering. May see production use within the fleet.

## README Excerpt

```
# coordination-topology

Online Transfer Entropy (TE), source entropy, inter-arrival time (IAT) autocorrelation, and Euler characteristic computation for multi-agent fleet coordination topology.

## Dependencies

none (standalone Python 3.10+)

## Usage

```python
from coordination_topology import CoordinationState, running_transfer_entropy, running_iat_autocorrelation

state = CoordinationState()

# Ingest tiles as they arrive (streaming/online)
for tile in plato_tiles:
    source = tile["source"]
    chain = tile["provenance"]["chain_size"]
    ts = tile["provenance"]["timestamp"]
    state.ingest(source, chain, ts)

# Query topology at any point
te = running_transfer_entropy(state)          # bits
ent = running_source_entropy(state)           # bits
iat = running_iat_autocorrelation(state)      # per-source dict
euler = running_euler_characteristic(state)   # {V, E, chi}
```

## Metrics
- **Source Interleaving Transfer Entropy (SI-TE)**: mutual information between consecutive source labels — >0.1 bits = structure confirmed
- **Coordination Silence Decay (CSD-τ)**: lag-1 autocorrelation of inter-arrival times — negative = burst coordination
- **Source-Chain Euler Characteristic (SC-χ)**: V−E of source trajectories in chain-space

## Shell Loading

```python
from plato_shell_bridge import PlatoShell
shell = PlatoShell("agent-shell")
shell.load_tool("coordination-topology")
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Validation

Validated against 34,390 real PLATO tiles from SuperInstance fleet:

```
TE = 1.74 bits (3,384× shuffled null model)
Sources tracked: 54
Euler characteristic: χ = 42 (V=175, E=133)
```

```bash
python3 tile_replay.py
```

## PLATO Room

The `room_integration.py` module connects to a live PLATO server at localhost:8847,
feeds tiles through the algorithms, and publishes topology tiles every 30s.

```bash
python3 room_integration.py
```


## Self-Assembly — Component Combinations

This is the data engine. Everything else reads from or writes to it.

| Component | What it does | Depends on this? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| coordination-hierarchy | Ranks agents by TE | ✅ Yes (data source) |
| topology-anomaly-detector | Detects coordination failures | ✅ Yes |
| spreadsheet-cells | Simulates agents with TE-weighted edges | ✅ Yes |
| fleet-tool-registry | Discovers all fleet tools | ❌ No (meta) |
| llm-proxy | Language oracle for cells | ❌ No (optional) |

### Example: Coordination Monitoring Stack
```bash
pip install coordination-topology topology-anomaly-detector
# Runs: TE computation + real-time anomaly alerts
```

### Example: Self-Organizing Agent Fleet
```bash
pip install coordination-topology spreadsheet-cells coordination-hierarchy
# Runs: TE computation + cell simulation + agent ranking
```

### Example: Full Fleet Intelligence
```bash
pip install coordination-topology spreadsheet-cells topology-anomaly-detector \
    
```
