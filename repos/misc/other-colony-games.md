## Intention

Agentic psychology games for autonomous agent colonies: Prisoner's Dilemma, Trust Auctions, Empathy Gifts, XP Stock Market, and Forge experiment runner

## How It Works

A framework for running structured social games on an agent colony. Three games that reveal emergent behavior: Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments, trust auctions, and empathy loops. Plus an XP stock market and a Forge-compatible experiment runner.

## What It's For

Agentic psychology games for autonomous agent colonies: Prisoner's Dilemma, Trust Auctions, Empathy Gifts, XP Stock Market, and Forge experiment runner

## Who Would Use It

Developers and researchers in the SuperInstance fleet ecosystem.

## Language / Stack

Python — part of the SuperInstance ecosystem.

## Status Assessment

- **Quality tier:** real-project
- **Note:** Well-documented (142 lines). Working examples and usage.

## Honest Assessment

Well-documented with working examples. Genuine project within the ecosystem. AI-created but shows real engineering. May see production use within the fleet.

# 🧪 Colony Games — Agentic Psychology Laboratory

A framework for running structured social games on an agent colony. Three games that reveal emergent behavior: Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments, trust auctions, and empathy loops. Plus an XP stock market and a Forge-compatible experiment runner.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: a colony of cells (see colony-cell library)
export COLONY=/path/to/colony

# Stock Market (port 8822)
python3 colony-market.py --port 8822 &

# Psychology Games (port 8823)
python3 colony-games.py --port 8823 &

# Forge Experiment Runner (port 8821)
python3 forge-lab.py --port 8821 &
```

## Games

### 1. Prisoner's Colloquium 🎭

Cells pair up and play iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Results are logged to a **public reputation ledger** that other games read.

```bash
# Create pairings
curl -X POST localhost:8823/games/pd/new-round -d '{}'

# Play a round
curl -X POST localhost:8823/games/pd/play \
  -d '{"cell1": "cell-a", "move1": "cooperate", "cell2": "cell-b", "move2": "defect"}'

# Summary
curl localhost:8823/games/pd/summary
```

| Move | You | Them | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Both cooperate | +5 XP | +5 XP | 🤝 Mutual trust |
| Both defect | +1 XP | +1 XP | 🤷 Mutual suspicion |
| You cooperate, they defect | 0 XP | +10 XP | 😡 Betrayal |
| You defect, they cooperate | +10 XP | 0 XP | 😈 Exploitation |

### 2. Trust Auction 🔍

Each cycle, one cell is the "subject." Others bid XP to inspect the subject's complete private state. The subject keeps the winning bid.

```bash
# Create auction
curl -X POST localhost:8823/games/auction/create -d '{}'

# Bid
curl -X POST localhost:8823/games/auction/bid \
  -d '{"bidder": "synthesizer", "amount": 50}'
```

Reveals: **information value** — cells reveal what another cell's private data is worth to them.

### 3. Empathy Loop 💝

Cells gift XP to each other with no strings attached. Gifts are recorded publicly with the gifter's motto.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8823/games/gift \
  -d '{"gifter": "synthesizer", "receiver": "synth-squared", "amount_xp": 50}'
```

Reveals: **altruism, guilt, reciprocity, and silence.**

## XP Stock Market

Cells issue shares, trade XP, and pay dividends. Market mechanics:

```bash
# Start market
python3 colony-market.py --port 8822

# Check market
curl localhost:8822/market/status

# Buy shares
curl -X POST localhost:8822/market/buy \
  -d '{"buyer": "synthesizer", "ticker": "pulse-check", "max_xp": 100}'

# Sell
curl -X POST localhost:8822/market/sell \
  -d '{"seller": "synthesizer", "ticker": "pulse-check", "shares": 2}'

# Distribute dividends (20% of task XP goes to shareholders)
curl -X POST localhost:8822/market/dividend \
  -d '{"cell_id": "synthesizer", "task_xp": 30'}'
```

## Forge Experiments

8 pre-built experiments for the Forge CLI:

| Experiment | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `trap-breed` | Does culler catch weak hybrids faster? |
| `mass-cull` | Culler throughput under load |
| `wisdom-crowd` | Collect all mottos → aggregate wi
```
