# creative-engine-c

Dynamical systems for creative processes — Lorenz attractors, regime detection (fixed-point/periodic/chaotic), Kuramoto synchronization, signal quality metrics, and adaptive thermostats in pure C99.

## What This Gives You

- **Lorenz system** — 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration of the Lorenz attractor for chaotic creative drivers
- **Regime detection** — Classify system state as fixed-point, periodic, or chaotic
- **Kuramoto coupling** — Synchronize multiple oscillators for ensemble coherence
- **Quality metrics** — Novelty, coherence, and combined quality scores for generated material
- **Adaptive thermostat** — Automatically tune exploration rate based on output quality
- **Zero dependencies** — C99, only `<math.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`

## Quick Start

### Lorenz system

```c
#include "creative_engine.h"

lorenz_state_t state = { .x = 0.1, .y = 0.0, .z = 0.0 };
lorenz_params_t params = LORENZ_DEFAULT;  // σ=10, ρ=28, β=8/3

// Single RK4 step
state = lorenz_step(state, params, 0.01);

// Full trajectory
#define N 10000
lorenz_state_t trajectory[N + 1];
trajectory[0] = (lorenz_state_t){ .x = 1.0, .y = 1.0, .z = 1.0 };
lorenz_integrate(trajectory[0], params, 0.01, N, trajectory);
```

### Regime detection and quality

```c
// Detect which regime the system is in
regime_t regime = detect_regime(trajectory, N + 1);
// REGIME_CHAOTIC for ρ=28

// Quality metrics on output
quality_t q = compute_quality(trajectory, N + 1);
printf("novelty=%.3f coherence=%.3f quality=%.3f
", q.novelty, q.coherence, q.quality);
```

## Build & Test

```bash
make              # build static library + test binary
make test         # build and run tests
make clean
```
