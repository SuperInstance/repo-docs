## README Excerpt

```
# 🐚 crab — Agent Shell for Repo Entry/Leave

> Like entering a MUD room: step into a repo, use its tools, and step out.

Crab is the fleet's shell for **entering and leaving repos** (shells). An agent (or human) can enter a repo, browse its manifest and tools, run commands, watch for outputs, and leave cleanly.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
bash install.sh

# Enter a repo
crab enter ~/.openclaw/workspace/arch-sw

# See what's available
crab whoami

# Run a tool from the repo
crab tool install

# Inspect another repo without entering
crab inspect ~/.openclaw/workspace/purplepincher-org-pages

# Watch a repo for outputs
crab watch ~/.openclaw/workspace/research/seed-tick-audit

# Inherit tools from another repo
crab follow ~/.openclaw/workspace/fleet/vessel

# See full status
crab status

# Leave
crab leave
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `crab enter <path>` | Enter a repo — reads MANIFEST, loads tools, starts TICK |
| `crab leave` | Leave current repo — stops TICK, pops from stack |
| `crab list` | List available repos (scan for MANIFEST) |
| `crab whoami` | Show current repo context + available tools |
| `crab inspect <path>` | Show repo MANIFEST + tick + tools without entering |
| `crab tool <name> [args]` | Run a tool from the current repo |
| `crab watch <path>` | Subscribe to a repo's outputs (IO pulls) |
| `crab follow <path>` | Inherit tools from another repo |
| `crab status` | Show entered repos, their health, and tools |

## Manifest Format

Crab works with any of these manifest formats in a repo directory:

### `MANIFEST.md` (Markdown)

```markdown
# My Repo

Description of what this repo provides.

## Tools

- `install.sh` — Install this repo's components
- `uninstall.sh` — Remove this repo's components
- `deploy.sh` — Deploy to production (http://localhost:8900/deploy)

## Provides

- logging
- auth
- routing
```

### `MANIFEST.yaml`

```yaml
name: my-repo
description: A fleet service repo
port: 8900
status: core
tools:
  - name: install
    type: script
    path: scripts/install.sh
    description: Install this repo
  - name: health
    type: http
    endpoint: http://localhost:8900/health
    description: Health check
provides:
  - auth-service
```

### `MANIFEST.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-repo",
  "description": "JSON manifest example",
  "port": 8847,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "status",
      "type": "http",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8847/status"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Auto-detected Tools

If no tools are explicitly listed in the manifest, crab will auto-detect:

- `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` at repo root
- Executable scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Any file referenced in the `provides` list found at standard paths

## Tool Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `script` | Run a local script | `crab tool install` → runs `install.sh` |
| `http` | Call an HTTP endpoint | `crab tool health` → POST to URL |
| `builtin` | Built-in crab handl
```
